# sunken-serpentines-generator
Module for tile based map generation.

TODO

- We can consider processing LCG output with a hash function to get better random number. It could provide better statistical distribution.
- We can consider adding random walk like, or limited lenght trees to maze areas to create more organic areas.

Overall Project Stack

- For backend this product could act like a SaaS product and require basic user functionality.
- For frontend part Godot could be a good options for releasing the content for mobile.
